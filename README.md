**🎯 Business Problem**

Bike Dekho wanted to understand the demographics and socioeconomic factors that drive bike purchases. The goal was to identify patterns in customer behavior and provide insights to guide targeted marketing and sales strategies.

**🔍 Methodology**

Cleaned and prepared raw sales data (removed duplicates, fixed categories, created age groups).

Built PivotTables and PivotCharts for demographic and purchase-based analysis.

Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers to visualize insights effectively.

**🛠 Skills Used**

Excel: Data cleaning, PivotTables, PivotCharts, Dashboard creation

**📈 Results and Business Recommendations**

Bike purchase behavior is influenced more by income, education, and occupation than by gender or homeownership.

Professionals, singles, and higher-income groups are the most promising customer segments.

Targeted campaigns, financing options for lower-income buyers, and region-specific strategies could help increase sales.
